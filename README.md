Introduction to Create React App

Create React App is a popular tool used to bootstrap React projects quickly. It simplifies the setup process by providing a pre-configured environment, allowing developers to focus on building their applications rather than configuring the build tools.

Scripts for Development
Within your project directory, you can execute several scripts:

npm start: Initiates the development server and runs your React application in development mode. Your application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000. Any changes you make to the code will automatically trigger a reload in the browser. If there are any errors in your code, they will be displayed in the console.

npm test: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. This is useful for running your tests continuously as you make changes to your code.

npm run build: Builds your application for production. The optimized build is generated in the build folder. React is bundled in production mode, ensuring the best performance. Additionally, files are minified, and the filenames include unique hashes for cache busting. Your application is now ready to be deployed.
Ejecting from Create React App

The npm run eject command is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot revert back. Ejecting exposes all the configuration files and dependencies (such as webpack, Babel, ESLint) used by Create React App. This allows you to have full control over your project's build setup. However, it's important to note that ejecting is optional, and you're not required to do so.

Create React App provides a curated feature set that is suitable for most deployments.
